### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-time.git
   cd tic-tac-time
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup Appwrite Backend**
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```
   
   You'll be prompted for:
   - Appwrite endpoint (default: `https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1`)
   - Project ID (from your Appwrite console)
   - API Key (create one in Settings → API Keys with scope: `databases.read`, `databases.write`)

   This automatically creates:
   - ✅ Database: `tictactime_db`
   - ✅ Collection: `tictactime_games` with all attributes
   - ✅ Indexes for optimal query performance
   - ✅ `.env` file with configuration

4. **Configure Appwrite Console**
   - Go to your Appwrite project → **Settings → Platforms**
   - Add a new **Web App**:
     - Name: `Tic-Tac-Time`
     - Hostname: `localhost` (for development)
     - Add your production domain when deploying

5. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL shown in terminal)

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview  # Preview production build locally
```

## 🎯 Game Modes

### 🎲 Normal Mode (3D)
<details>
<summary><b>Classic 3D Tic-Tac-Toe</b></summary>

- **Grid**: 3×3×3 cube (single time slice)
- **Objective**: Get 3 marks in a row
- **Win Types**:
  - Straight lines (X, Y, or Z axis)
  - Face diagonals (2D diagonals on cube faces)
  - Space diagonals (3D diagonals through cube center)
- **Total Win Lines**: 49 possible winning combinations
</details>

### ⏰ Fight Across Time Mode (4D)
<details>
<summary><b>Strategic Time Manipulation</b></summary>

- **Grid**: 3×3×3×3 hypercube (Past, Present, Future)
- **Objective**: Get 3-4 marks aligned in 4D space
- **Mechanics**:
  - Each turn, choose any time slice to place your mark
  - Past moves can create chain reactions
  - Future moves become "prophecies" that lock in place
- **Win Types**:
  - All Normal Mode wins (within a single time slice)
  - Temporal lines (same position across time)
  - 4D diagonals (space + time combinations)
- **Total Win Lines**: 147+ possible winning combinations
- **Strategy Tips**:
  - Control the Present (T2) for maximum flexibility
  - Use Past (T1) to set up multi-timeline threats
  - Block opponent's temporal chains early
</details>

### 👥 Local Multiplayer
<details>
<summary><b>Hot-Seat Play</b></summary>
